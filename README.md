Web Piano Academy is a fully functioning e-commerce web application. The site allows users to view and purchase digital piano courses online. Users can easily create personal accounts and profiles and see information on the site, and the courses themselves. The site also enables administrators to add, edit and remove products, as well as view and rspond to contact enquiries.

## UX

The design philosophy was to create a fun, engaging look, while keeping relevant information presented in a salient and clean manner, allowing the user to easily and pleasingly navigate through the site.

### Colour Scheme


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/2c6967-f8ddd0-e67e7c-ed8500-000000-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site.
